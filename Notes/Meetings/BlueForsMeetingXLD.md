- XLD Fast exchange: 50 mm tube, 58 mm, 78 mm (76 mm available) 10/15 cm height. Cooldown: 24 h regular fridge. Almost the same for fast cooldown. Height of the ceiling should be high. Two and three pulse tube option. The height should be precise. Extra pricing: Quote.
- Wiring should be ordered at the same time. Complicated. 
- Options: High density wiring: Side loading
- Wiring for LNF possible. Not the rest
- Caltech amplifier maybe later: https://www.cosmicmicrowavetechnology.com/copy-of-cit412  ?
- Vibrations: Like LD, heavy plate or active
- LD + SD around the same price probably. Check the price with options
- No backing in the bottom loader
