# VacuumCavity

Attempt to bake and measure a cavity which is not vacuum tight.  We start from the Yale design. 
It will simply be a tube with two CF Flanges DN 63 CF (inner distance 66mm)
One side will be an OHFC copper Flange (lower flange) with the valve attached to it 
The other side will be a stainless steel flange with sma feedthrough and DC micro sub D 9 pins (possible to do both in Copper...)
